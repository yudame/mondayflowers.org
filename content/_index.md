Our organization celebrates the accomplishments of women. Every Monday, flowers boost positivity and inspiration. We are a whole-hearted movement to promote those goals and accomplishement. And that is made possible when we believe and let our passion turn into action.

As an organization, we insist that every interaction is personal. Each flower is hand-picked, each thoughtful note is hand-written. Because we value you, each customer's experience unique.

With an insistance to start each week with fresh energy and a reminder of the beauty in life, Monday Flowers is a weekly reminder to embrace whatever comes next with joy and optimism.

All profits are donated to charity that promotes women's empowerment.
